## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- imbalanced-learn

You can install these packages using pip.

## Data Loading

The dataset is loaded from a Parquet file. The relevant columns are selected and basic statistics are inspected.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing step includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features. Pipelines are used to streamline these processes for both numerical and categorical features.

## Feature Engineering

New features are created to enhance the predictive power of the model, including transformations of existing features.

## Model Training

Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated using cross-validation. The best performing model is selected for final training. Data is split into training and validation sets to ensure robust evaluation.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. A classification report is generated to summarize the model's performance.

## Model Saving

The trained model is saved to a file for future use. This enables easy loading and use of the model without retraining.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for building and evaluating a machine learning model for predicting product return reasons. The model is saved to a file and can be loaded for future use or further evaluation.
